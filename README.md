# RB-Tree

## Algorithms & Data Structures III Project

</div>

## Description

This project implements a Red-Black Tree in C, a self-balancing binary search tree. The implementation is based on the book **"Introduction to Algorithms"** by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein.

The project is divided into three main files:
- `Functions.h`: Contains the function declarations and data structures.
- `Functions.c`: Implements the functions defined in the header file.
- `Main.c`: The main program that demonstrates the usage of the Red-Black Tree.

## Features

- Insertion of nodes into the Red-Black Tree.
- Deletion of nodes while maintaining tree properties.
- Search for specific keys in the tree.
- Printing the tree structure.

## How to Run

To compile the project, use the following command:

```bash
make
```
To execute the program, use:

```bash
./myrb < input_file > output_file
```
